# DeepGenerativeFinancialLosses
This is an unsupervised learning problem: Given real data from stock market indexes that will act as a train dataset,
the task is to learn a generative model that simulates synthetic stock market indexes.  

The difficulty mainly lies in two points : 
a) find an appropriate transformation to generate extreme values for some given input noise,
b) learning a generative model based on a dataset which contains very few extreme data.
